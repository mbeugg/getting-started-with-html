  <h1> HTML and The Web</h1>
<eM>What is HTML?</em><br>

<p>HTML is <b>Hypertext Mark-Up Language. </b> 
The vast majority of documents on the web
are written in HTML.</p>
<em>What are the major pieces of the Web?</em>
<p>The Web connects the computers of individual users and their browsers to the internet,
which is in turn connected to servers through http. </p>
<em>What are HTML tags?</em><br><p>HTML tags are commands that govern the look, style, and links of webpages written in HTML.
Their syntax is usually of the form <b>name contents /name</b>, with greater than-less than signs around the name of the tag.

</p>
Some tags, especially those that insert links into webpages, have attributes as part of their command.
These attributes can specify the address of the webpage, picture, or video. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-3571439057">This video link</a> is an example of an anchor tag with an attribute, and it does happen to be about html tags!. </p
><em>What are the basic categories of HTML tags?</em>
<P>Most complete "elements" have both an opening and closing tag,
but <b>void tags</b> have only the opening tag.  
Two examples of void tags are img, the image tag,
and br, the break tag, which is kind of like a carriage return.

</p>Another specialized category of tag is the <b>block tag.</b>
The block tag appears to combine a command with a carriage return.
This seems to follow from the fact that block tags create "invisible boxes"
around the text or content they envelope.
<p>The last (and perhaps largest?) category of tag is the <b>inline tag.</B>
These tags apply their formatting to the document within the line in which they were inserted without adding any extra space.

Some examples of these are a, span, br, img, and strong. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723438">This video link</a> is a summary of inline vs. block elements.</a></p
